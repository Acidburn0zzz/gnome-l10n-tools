Tools to help translators of GNOME Project

What is this!
-------------

For now this is  just an experiment that eventually will get a full set of tools 
to help GNOME translators and commiters to make their work easier.

I have plans to create some commands like:

-   Fetch real-time stats from Damned Lies 
-   Use real-time stats to fetch uncompleted translations and raise an editor to complete them
-   Allow to upload completed translations by handling conflicts and rebases.

Installation
============

Using composer (http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) you have to 
install all the dependencies.

 composer.phar install


Usage
-----

You can get all the available commands by checking the build in help

 ./console --help
 ./console command:name --help

And... what else?
